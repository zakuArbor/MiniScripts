<p><h1><b>MENU SYSTEM</b></h1></p>
<p><b>Project Idea Source:</b> https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/undergraduate/CMSC291C/summer01/burt/proj.html</p>
The unix help menu system is a shell script that helps user run some basic unix commands such as seeing the contents of the file, removing a file/dir, searching for a pattern through a file, and etc without knowing the commands itself. This menu system is very basic and may differ a bit from the project idea since I do not know what the expected output of the program. This was just an excercise to brush up my unix and shell programming.
